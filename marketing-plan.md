Rise of independent assistants, this gives us a roadmap for future assistants, this is a W3C roadmap to an interoperable future, call to action -- what do we want you to do with this? review and send comments, join the group, 
* what about the technical part? high level -- what are the top three aspects of the technical part, then a second, broader, deeper layer
